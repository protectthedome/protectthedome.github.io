SR_Init
	Arguments: None
	Return nothing

{
	set up port A by enabling the peripheral clock, waiting for the 
	peripheral to be ready and setting the direction
	of PA2, PA3 & PA3 to output
	Turn on PORTA
	Wait for the port clock to come online
	Set PA2, PA3, and PA4 as digital outputs
	Leave the configuration for the above ports as totem-poles
	start with the data & sclk lines low and the RCLK line high
}

SR_GetCurrentRegister
	Arugments: None
	Returns last value what was sent (32-bit uint)
{
  return LocalRegisterImage
}

void SR_Write
	Arguments: Value to write
	Returns nothing
	Shifts through the 24bits of the value to write, placing each bit into
	the register. Once complete, it sets the output of the register.
{
	lower the register clock
	copy into module var holder for read back
	Loop through all the bits in dataSR
		Isolate the MSB of NewValue, put it into the LSB position and output to port
		shift out the data while pulsing the serial clock 
		Isolate the MSB of NewValue, put it into the LSB position and output to port
		Pulse PBO
		Shift dataSR left 1 bit
	finish looping through bits in NewValue
	raise the register clock to latch the new data
}
